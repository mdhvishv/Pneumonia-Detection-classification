        <p>
            Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.
            It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and it leads to symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing.
            Pneumonia can range from mild to severe and can affect people of all ages, but it is most dangerous for young children, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems.
            Understanding the causes, symptoms, and risk factors of pneumonia is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment.

        <h2>Famous Research</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, numerous research studies have contributed to advancing our knowledge of pneumonia and improving treatment outcomes.
            Some notable research findings include the discovery of new strains of bacteria responsible for pneumonia, the development of effective vaccines, and the identification of risk factors associated with pneumonia complications.
            These research efforts continue to shape our understanding of the disease and inform medical interventions and preventive measures.

    <section id="treatments">
        <h2>Treatments</h2>
        <p>
            The treatment of pneumonia depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the infection.
            In bacterial pneumonia cases, antibiotics are typically prescribed to eliminate the bacteria causing the infection.
            Viral pneumonia, on the other hand, often requires supportive care to manage symptoms and allow the body's immune system to fight off the virus.
            Treatment plans may also include rest, hydration, over-the-counter pain relievers, and in severe cases, hospitalization.
            It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.
